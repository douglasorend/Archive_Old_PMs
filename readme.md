# ARCHIVE OLD PMS v1.3

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4165)

------

## Introduction
This mod moves conversation PMs that are over a user-specified number of days to the bottom of the PM list.  It also attaches an "archived" image to the PM subject, making it easy to identify which PMs have been archived.

The number of days is set on a per-member basis and is initially set to **0**.  Changing this value lower than it's current value does not unarchive messages already marked as archived.

## Profile Settings
There is a new setting in **My Messages** => **Preferences** => **Change Settings**:
o **Enable archiving personal messages?**
o **Archive personal messages older than [nobbc][x][/nobbc] days**

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.15 and SMF 2.1 Beta 3 using a MySQL database, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.  Postgres databases have not been tested.
